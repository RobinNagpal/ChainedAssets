# Introduction - Blockchain and Finance
Blockchain has real value which has been proven by
- Adoption of Stablecoins and how they can be transferred across borders with minimal fees
- Facilitation of exchange of assets with AMMs
- Creation of derivative products like 
  - 2x, 3x,...,50x leverage tokens
  - Perpetual Futures
- Querying of data from blockchain and creating charts and graphs(like Dune Analytics)

A product gets adopted when it is 10 times better as compared to the existing solutions, or offers a completely new 
solution to a problem.

# Why is blockchain not adopted by the masses?
- Banks and Financial Institutions 
    - maintain the local government identity of the user and complies with the local laws.
    - provide custody of the assets
    - provide way to recover the assets in case of loss of information by the user 
- Blockchain doesn't talk about these things and has not really tried to solve for this. This area is expensive and 
  requires a lot of legal work. so companies have stayed away from this.
- Normally technology adoption is a gradual process, specially when dealing with money. New systems have to be intergrated
  into old way of working. Like just giving tokens doesn't "Assure" people of the possession of the assets.


Note: These are the areas we want to explore under "ChainedAssets". For this we need to identify real isolated use cases 
come up with a clear plan, and then execute on it.

### Things we want to explore
- [ ] What are the exact requirements for 
  - ATS(Alternative Trading System)
  - Custodians
  - Transfer Agents
  - Broker-Dealers
  - Trust Companies(Trusts are created for REITs, infrastructure or investment companies)?
- [ ] Find a few different players in the market under these categories. Not the top players, but more of startups.
- [ ] Find who uses these players, for what use cases and how much do they pay them?

# Private Markets
- Private markets are only accessible by accredited investors, and there are not many government regulations on these 
  markets.
- These markets are not very liquid and are not very transparent.

Note: This is where blockchain can help and under "ChainedAssets" we want to explore this area. We plan to explore private
credit first.

### Things we want to explore in Private Credit
- [ ] Some of the new players in the market who have been doing well
- [ ] What type of information is available in the private credit market?
- [ ] For how long are the assets locked? 
- [ ] How valuable is providing liquidity to these markets?
- [ ] Is any type of trading really needed in these markets?

### Crowdfunding
This is a new market and has been growing. It suffers for the following issues
- Lack of liquidity
- Lack of information on the projects and its founders
- No ratings or reviews available
- Pricing of the projects/assets is not determined by the market

### Things we want to explore in Crowdfunding
- [ ] Why do founder don't want their projects shares to be traded?
- [ ] What premium cam be charged for providing liquidity for these projects?
- [ ] What players currently offer liquidity/trading for these projects? And why is it not so popular?
- [ ] How exactly exchange of these assets can be done?
- [ ] Why do founders what their companies to remain private for so long? Example stripe, spacex, etc. Should government
  intervene in this and ask them to go public?
