# Introduction - Blockchain and Finance
Blockchain has proven its value through:
- Adoption of stablecoins that allow money transfers across borders with low fees.
- Facilitated asset exchanges using automated market makers (AMMs).
- Creation of derivative products such as:
  - Leverage tokens (2x, 3x, up to 50x)
  - Perpetual futures
- Use of blockchain data to create charts and graphs, like with Dune Analytics.

A product is widely adopted if it is ten times better than current solutions or offers a completely new solution to a problem.

# Why is blockchain not adopted widely?
- Banks and financial institutions:
  - Preserve a userâ€™s identity as per local government regulations.
  - Safeguard assets.
  - Offer ways to recover assets if user information is lost.
- Blockchain has not addressed these issues, which involve extensive legal work and costs, so blockchain companies have avoided them, as there are easier ways to make money.
- Technology adoption, especially in finance, is gradual. Integrating new systems with old ones takes time. Simply 
offering tokens does not guarantee ownership of assets to the investors. They are used to docs and contracts, so 
along with tokens, we need to provide them with the necessary docs and contracts. Blockchain projects have not been
pragmatic in this regard.

# Improving the Efficiency of the Financial System
- The current financial system is inefficient, and blockchain could significantly enhance its efficiency.
- We need to identify specific areas where blockchain can be applied effectively.

Note: We want to explore these topics under "ChainedAssets". We aim to find isolated use cases, develop a clear plan, and execute it.

### Areas to Explore
- [ ] What are the specific requirements for:
  - Alternative Trading Systems (ATS)
  - Custodians
  - Transfer Agents
  - Broker-Dealers
  - Trust Companies (used for REITs, infrastructure, or investment companies)?
- [ ] Identify emerging companies in these areas, not just the leaders but also startups.
- [ ] Determine who uses these services, for what purposes, and how much they pay.

# Private Markets
- Private markets are open only to accredited investors and have fewer government regulations.
- These markets lack liquidity and transparency.

Note: Blockchain could be valuable here, and under "ChainedAssets," we plan to first explore private credit.

### Exploring Private Credit
- [ ] Identify new market players who are performing well.
- [ ] Discover what information is available in the private credit market.
- [ ] Understand how long assets are locked.
- [ ] Assess the value of providing liquidity in these markets.
- [ ] Determine if trading is necessary in these markets.

### Crowdfunding
This growing market faces challenges such as:
- Limited liquidity.
- Insufficient information about projects and their founders.
- Absence of ratings or reviews.
- Non-market-driven pricing of projects and assets.

### Questions for Crowdfunding
- [ ] Why do founders resist trading shares of their projects?
- [ ] What premium can be charged for providing liquidity to these projects?
- [ ] Which companies currently offer liquidity or trading for these projects, and why is it not more popular?
- [ ] How can the exchange of these assets be facilitated?
- [ ] Why do founders keep their companies private for extended periods, like Stripe and SpaceX? Should the government encourage them to go public?
