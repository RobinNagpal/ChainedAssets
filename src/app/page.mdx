## Major Technological Advancements in RWA Tokenization {{ date: '2017-12-01T00:00Z' }}

The concept of asset tokenization, while gaining traction, was still relatively nascent in 2017. The blockchain
technology and infrastructure necessary to support large-scale asset tokenization were still in their early stages of
development.

### <SparkleIcon /> Major Developments
Some of the tokenization technologies that were developed in 2017 include:
- Tether enabled tokenized US dollars to be exchanged on the Ethereum network for the first time
- Harbor enabled tokenization of private securities to enhance liquidity and reduce transaction costs.
- Securitize enabled the tokenization of traditional securities, broadening investor access and improving transparency.
- tZERO enabled trading of tokenized assets on a regulated platform, promoting transparency and liquidity.
- Vertalo allowed management of tokenized alternative assets with tools focused on compliance and investor relations.
